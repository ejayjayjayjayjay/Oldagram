# Oldagram - Scrimba Project

A fun project that lets you create an Instagram-like feed for displaying photos, but with a vintage or retro twist. It's a common project on Scrimba to practice basic HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skills.

## Features

- **Feed of Posts**: Similar to Instagram, users see a feed of "posts," but here you might be using older or "vintage-style" photos.
- **Basic Interactivity**: add like buttons or simple animations (like showing the number of likes) to make it interactive.
- **Learning Goals**: The project helps me understand how to structure a webpage, style it to look like a social media feed, and add simple JavaScript functions to interact with it.
